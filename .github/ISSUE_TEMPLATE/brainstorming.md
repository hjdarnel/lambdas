**Concept/How would it work?**
What is the idea? What sort of data would you pass in, and what would you expect to receive in return?

**Dependencies**
Is there a requirement on another service or product for this to work? Remember, these functions should be stateless and highly independent.

**Any high level design you're thinking of?**
Code-wise, have you thought of a workflow yet?
